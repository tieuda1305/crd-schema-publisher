# crd-schema-publisher

Extracts CRD JSON schemas from a Kubernetes cluster and publishes them to a Cloudflare Pages site you control. Runs as a Kubernetes Deployment or CronJob in a distroless nonroot container. Designed for IDE validation, CI linting, and interactive schema documentation.

**[Live demo →](https://kube-schemas.shold.io)**

## 💡 Why

Most CRD schema solutions rely on static catalogs — community-maintained repositories that scrape schemas from popular Helm charts. Schemas go stale, internal CRDs are missing, and your validation pipeline depends on third-party infrastructure.

This tool reads schemas directly from your cluster's API server and publishes them to infrastructure you control.

- **Always accurate** — schemas reflect exactly what's installed in your cluster, including custom and internal CRDs, updated automatically when CRDs change
- **Self-hosted** — published to your own Cloudflare Pages site, removing third-party dependencies from your validation pipeline
- **Single static binary** — no runtime dependencies, no interpreters, no package managers. One binary in a distroless nonroot container with no shell
- **Kubernetes-native** — watch mode uses the controller pattern with informers, leader election, debounced publish cycles, and health probes. It's a proper workload, not a script on a timer

The JSON Schema conversion improves upon the widely-used [openapi2jsonschema.py](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/blob/master/scripts/openapi2jsonschema.py) — see [How It Works](#%EF%B8%8F-how-it-works) for details.

## 🚀 Deploying

### Watch Mode (recommended)

Reacts to CRD changes in real-time with debounced publish cycles. Supports leader election for safe rolling updates. The container runs with `args: ["watch"]` — see [`deploy/deployment.yaml`](deploy/deployment.yaml).

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/common.yaml -f deploy/deployment.yaml
```

### CronJob Mode

Runs extract + upload on a schedule. Simpler, but schemas are only updated when the job runs. The example uses a daily schedule — adjust the `schedule` field as needed. Uses the default `run` command — see [`deploy/cronjob.yaml`](deploy/cronjob.yaml).

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/common.yaml -f deploy/cronjob.yaml
```

Both modes share [`deploy/common.yaml`](deploy/common.yaml) which provides namespace, ServiceAccount, RBAC (ClusterRole for CRD read access), and a hardened security context (nonroot, read-only rootfs, dropped capabilities).

The deploy manifests include a placeholder Secret named `cloudflare-credentials`. To provide your Cloudflare credentials, either edit the placeholder values in `common.yaml` directly before applying, or replace the Secret resource with your own secrets management (e.g., ExternalSecret, Sealed Secret). If the Secret is omitted, both modes run extract-only (schemas written to `OUTPUT_DIR` but not uploaded).

### Container Image

Pre-built multi-arch images (amd64 + arm64) are published to GHCR:

```text
ghcr.io/sholdee/crd-schema-publisher:latest
```

Each push to `main` with application code changes creates a GitHub Release with a date-based tag (`vYYYY.MMDD.HHMMSS`) and auto-generated release notes including the image digest. PR builds get `pr-N` tags for testing.

Images use `gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot` as the runtime base — no shell, no package manager, runs as UID 65534. Production images are signed with [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) keyless signing via GitHub Actions OIDC:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/sholdee/crd-schema-publisher:latest \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp github.com/sholdee/crd-schema-publisher
```

### Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Variables marked *(watch)* apply only to watch mode deployment.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Yes (run/upload) | — | Cloudflare API token with Pages permissions |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Yes (run/upload) | — | Cloudflare account ID |
| `CF_PAGES_PROJECT` | No | `kubernetes-schemas` | Cloudflare Pages project name |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | No | `/output` | Directory for schema output |
| `KUBECTL_CONTEXT` | No | — | Kubernetes context name (local development only) |
| `DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` | No | `15` | Seconds to wait after last CRD event before publishing (watch mode) |
| `POD_NAME` | Yes (watch) | — | Pod identity for leader election (set via downward API) |
| `POD_NAMESPACE` | Yes (watch) | — | Namespace for leader lease (set via downward API) |
| `LEASE_NAME` | No | `crd-schema-publisher` | Name of the Lease resource (watch mode) |
| `HEALTH_PORT` | No | `8080` | Port for liveness/readiness probes (watch mode) |
| `PREVIEW_ADDR` | No | `127.0.0.1:8989` | Listen address for preview server (preview mode) |
| `SKIP_RENDER` | No | — | Set to `true` to skip HTML schema page rendering |

### Monitoring

In watch mode, the health server exposes a `/metrics` endpoint on `HEALTH_PORT` (default 8080) in Prometheus text format.

| Metric | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `crdpublisher_publish_cycle_duration_seconds` | gauge | Duration of the most recent publish cycle |
| `crdpublisher_publish_cycle_total` | counter | Publish cycles by result (`success`, `error`) |
| `crdpublisher_crds_discovered` | gauge | CRDs found in the most recent cycle |
| `crdpublisher_schemas_written` | gauge | Schemas written in the most recent cycle |
| `crdpublisher_last_successful_publish_timestamp` | gauge | Unix epoch of the last successful publish |
| `crdpublisher_publish_skipped_total` | counter | Debounce skips (publish already in progress) |
| `crdpublisher_leader` | gauge | Whether this pod is the current leader |

The timestamp metric enables dead man's switch alerting — if `time() - crdpublisher_last_successful_publish_timestamp` exceeds your threshold, the process may be stuck.

To scrape with [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator), create a PodMonitor:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
  name: crd-schema-publisher
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: crd-schema-publisher
  podMetricsEndpoints:
    - port: health
      path: /metrics
```

For vanilla Prometheus, add `prometheus.io/*` annotations to the pod template or configure a static scrape target.

## 📋 Using Your Schemas

Once published, your schemas are available at `https://<your-pages-domain>/<apigroup>/<kind>_<version>.json`. The published site also includes a browsable index with search and interactive HTML documentation for each schema.

### IDE Validation (yaml-language-server)

Add a modeline to any YAML file. Works in VS Code, Neovim, Helix, and any editor with yaml-language-server:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://kube-schemas.example.com/cert-manager.io/certificate_v1.json
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: example
```

Or configure schemas globally in VS Code:

```jsonc
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://kube-schemas.example.com/cert-manager.io/certificate_v1.json": ["**/certificates/*.yaml"]
  }
}
```

### CI Validation (kubeconform)

Point kubeconform at your schema registry for CRD validation in CI:

```bash
kubeconform \
  -schema-location default \
  -schema-location 'https://kube-schemas.example.com/{{.Group}}/{{.ResourceKind}}_{{.ResourceAPIVersion}}.json' \
  manifests/*.yaml
```

This validates built-in Kubernetes resources against the default schemas and CRDs against your published schemas.

> **Note:** Schema files are written as lowercase (e.g., `certificate_v1.json`) while `{{.ResourceKind}}` expands to the original case (e.g., `Certificate`). This works on Cloudflare Pages because it serves paths case-insensitively — the same convention used by [datreeio/CRDs-catalog](https://github.com/datreeio/CRDs-catalog). If serving schemas from a case-sensitive host, use lowercase kind names in your template paths.

## Output Structure

```text
<output-dir>/
  <apigroup>/
    <kind>_<version>.json          # JSON schema
    <kind>_<version>.html          # Interactive documentation page
  master-standalone/
    <apigroup>-<kind>-stable-<version>.json  # kubeval-compatible format
  index.html                       # Browsable schema index
  favicon.svg                      # Constellation icon
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

```text
crd-schema-publisher [command]

Commands:
  run       Extract schemas and upload to Cloudflare Pages (default)
  extract   Extract schemas and generate index to OUTPUT_DIR
  upload    Upload OUTPUT_DIR contents to Cloudflare Pages
  watch     Watch for CRD changes and publish on each change (long-lived)
  preview   Generate index with sample data and serve locally for UI development
```

1. Connects to the Kubernetes API (in-cluster or via kubeconfig)
2. Lists all CRDs and extracts `.spec.versions[].schema.openAPIV3Schema`
3. Applies three JSON Schema transforms (improved from [openapi2jsonschema.py](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/blob/master/scripts/openapi2jsonschema.py)):
   - Adds `additionalProperties: false` to objects with `properties`
   - Replaces `int-or-string` format with `oneOf [string, integer]` while preserving existing keys
   - Allows null for optional fields (per-field precision, not per-parent)

   These improve on the Python original's handling of nullable fields, int-or-string types, and root objects. A frozen golden test locks converter output to prevent regressions.
4. Writes schemas to both primary and kubeval-compatible directory formats
5. Renders an interactive HTML documentation page for each schema with collapsible property trees
6. Generates an HTML index grouped by API group with client-side search, schema statistics, and yaml-language-server usage examples
7. Uploads to Cloudflare Pages via the direct upload API (BLAKE3 content hashing, batched uploads with retry)
